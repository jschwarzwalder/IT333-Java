 * Exercises - Basic Data Structures
 * 
 * An alternative to the deletion strategy we have given is to use lazy deletion. 
 * To delete an element, we merely mark it deleted (using a boolean field). 
 * The number of deleted and non-deleted elements in the list is kept as part of the data structure. 
 * If there are as many deleted elements as non-deleted elements, we traverse the entire list, 
 * performing the standard deletion algorithm on all marked nodes.
 * 
 * List the advantages and disadvantages of lazy deletion.
 * 
 * Write routines to implement the standard linked list operations using lazy deletion. 
 * As a minimum you should write the add(x), remove(x), size(), isEmpty() and contains(x) methods.
