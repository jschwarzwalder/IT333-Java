 1b) What is the running time of your program?
	Running time of the procedure is Length of L * Length of P ie Omega n and BigOh n^2

 3b) What is the running time of your program?
	Big O = 2n or  O(n) it goes through num of players to build the players list
	then again removing each player when Potato is passed. 

 4a) An alternative to the deletion strategy we have given is to use lazy deletion. To delete an element, we merely mark it deleted (using a boolean field). The number of deleted and non-deleted elements in the list is kept as part of the data structure. If there are as many deleted elements as non-deleted elements, we traverse the entire list, performing the standard deletion algorithm on all marked nodes.

	Advantage - You do not need to shift the arrayList when you add and remove elements
	Disadvantage- Can waste memory if you don't plan to add elements back into list
				More complicated to iterate through since you have to check if value is false
