o	Given two arrays of strings, call them A and B, return a new array with all string values in both A and B.

algorithm Intersection(A[0...n-1], X)
	//input: A List A of unique strings (no duplicates)
	//input: A List B of unique strings (no duplicates)
	//output: an array listing strings that were in both A and B
	
	t1[] <-- new ARRAY
	
	for i <-- 1 to n - 1
		for j <-- 1 to n - 1
			if A[i] = B[j]
				t1.add(A[i])
	
	return t1
