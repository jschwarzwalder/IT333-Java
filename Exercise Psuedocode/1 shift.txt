1. Give the pseudocode for an algorithm that reorders the elements of the following array:
 A = [x, y, z]  --> A = [y, z, x]
 What is the minimum number of assignment statements needed? 
 
algorithm shift(A[0...n-1])
//input: An ARRAY A
//output: An ARRAY A shifted
t1 <-- A[0]

for i <-- 1 to n-1
	A[i-1]<-- A[i]
A[n-1] <-- t1

return A[]
