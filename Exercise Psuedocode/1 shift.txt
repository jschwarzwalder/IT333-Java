1. Give the pseudocode for an algorithm that reorders the elements of the following array:
 A = [x, y, z]  --> A = [y, z, x]
 What is the minimum number of assignment statements needed? 4
algorithm shift(arrayXYZ)
//input: arrayXYZ 
//output: arrayXYZ shifted
store value of element in index 0 as variable holdValue
For length of arrayXYZ where i starts at 1
	move arrayXYZ[i] to arrayXYZ [i-1]
When finished assign variable holdValue to arrayXYZ 
at index of (length of arrayXYZ - 1)
return arrayXYZ
