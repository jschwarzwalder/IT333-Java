5. Give the pseudocode for an algorithm that inserts an integer x in the appropriate position of a list of sorted integers.
Example inputs: A = [2, 5, 13, 21],   x = 10        
Example list after the algorithm completes: A = [2, 5, 10, 13, 21]
algorithm insertIntoList(IntList, intX)
//input: sorted list of integers IntList
//input: single integer intX
//output: sorted array with intX value included
Get size of IntList and save to variable int sizeIntList
Create a variable int insertIndex, set it equal to sizeIntList/2
While insertIndex < sizeIntList - 1:
Get the value in the list at insertIndex and save to compareInt
Compare compareInt to intX
if intX is greater than compareInt
	add (sizeIntList-insertIndex)/2 to the insertIndex
else if intX is less than compareInt
	
	subtract (sizeIntList/2 - insertIndex)/2 to the insertIndex
