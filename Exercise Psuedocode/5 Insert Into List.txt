5. Give the pseudocode for an algorithm that inserts an integer x in the appropriate position of a list of sorted integers.
Example inputs: A = [2, 5, 13, 21],   x = 10        
Example list after the algorithm completes: A = [2, 5, 10, 13, 21]
algorithm insertIntoList(IntList, intX)
//input: sorted list of integers IntList
//input: single integer intX
//output: sorted array with intX value included
If intX > last value in IntList
	add intX to end of IntList
	return IntList
For each value in IntList
	If intX < value
		Insert intX into array at the current index
		Shift list as needed
		return IntList
