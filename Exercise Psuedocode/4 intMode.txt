4. Give the pseudocode for an algorithm that takes as an input a list of n integers in increasing order and returns the mode of the list (the value that appears most often).
algorithm intMode(arrayInt)
//input: sorted array of integers arrayInt
//output: integer value of the value that appears the most often
create new integer count and set to 0
create new integer modeCount and set to 0
create new integer modeValue and set to 0
for each value in arrayInt
	compare value to next value in array until you reach end - 1 of arrayInt
	If value is the same as next value
		increase count by 1
	else 
		compare count to modeCount
		if count is larger than modeCount
			set modeCount to count
			set modeValue to current value
			set count to 0
return modeValue
