3. Give the pseudocode for an algorithm that takes as an input a list of n integers in increasing order and produces a list of all values that occur more than once.
algorithm findDuplicates(arrayInt)
//input: sorted array of integers arrayInt
//output: array of values that appear more than once in arrayInt
create new integer array called duplicates
for each value in arrayInt
	compare value to next value in array until you reach end of arrayInt
	if the same look at last value in duplicates array
		If not in duplicates array 
			add to duplicates array
when done return duplicates array.
