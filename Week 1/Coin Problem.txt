3. Counterfeit coin problem Suppose you are given 10 stacks of 10 coins each. 9 stacks out of 10 have coins that weigh 1 gram each. The other stack has counterfeit coins that weigh 0.9 grams each. Given a scale to weigh coins, can you determine which stack of coins is counterfeit in one weighing.

Note: you can put any number of coins on the scale at once.

Take the number of coins from each stack that represents its number and weigh it. 
The counterfeit stack will be total - .1 * counterfeit stack number.

Example
Take 1 from stack 1
Take 2 from stack 2
Take 3 from stack 3
Take 4 from stack 4
Take 5 from stack 5
Take 6 from stack 6
Take 7 from stack 7
Take 8 from stack 8
Take 9 from stack 9

Option to include 10th stack
if you do not include and stack = 45 then 10th stack is counterfeit
if you do not include and stack = 44.3 then 7th stack is counterfeit.
