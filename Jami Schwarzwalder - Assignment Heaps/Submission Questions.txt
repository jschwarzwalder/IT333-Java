What are the advantages/disadvantages of your design above?
Advantage - The ternary heap is shallower than a binary heap.
Disadvantage - You have to do more comparisons between siblings when adding or removing 

Would you use a ternary heap or binary heap in your own code? Why?
A binary heap while deeper requires less comparisons than the ternary heap, and thus is easier to read and understand. 
Performance isn't improved by having 3 child nodes instead of 2. 
Both take up the same amount of space, since it is stored as an array

What is the big-oh for each of the operations on a ternary heap?

add(element) - O(logn)
peek() - O(1)
remove() - O(logn)
size() - O(1)
isEmpty() - O(1)
clear() - O(1)

How is the big-oh estimation for these functions different from the estimates for a binary heap.
A heap is a complete binary tree so it runs very efficiently O(logn). A binary tree can run for O(n) if the data is not inserted in properly and the tree is not self balancing.
